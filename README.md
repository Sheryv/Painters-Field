# Painters-Field

Painters Field is a very simple game inspired by old Battle Painters by Saito Games in which you must paint the screen with the color you are assigned as fast as possible. You compete with other players, who are computer controlled. The objective is to paint the higher percentage of the screen with your color before the time is up.
